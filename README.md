# Tcl Bug: Missing 'else' in 'if' statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl: a missing `else` clause in an `if` statement.  The code in `bug.tcl` illustrates the problem, and `bugSolution.tcl` provides the corrected version.

The bug results in incorrect logical flow, particularly when the condition in the `if` statement is not met. The corrected solution adds the missing `else` clause for correct execution.
